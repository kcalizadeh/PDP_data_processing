              "\"s, or what physical object means. Thus it is instruction about the use of words, and physical object is a logical concept (Like colour, quantity,. . .) And that is why no such proposition as: There are physical objects can be formulated. Yet we encounter such unsuccessful shots at every turn. But is it an adequate answer to the scepticism of the idealist, or the assurances of the realist, to say that There are physical objects is nonsense? For them after all it is not nonsense. It would, however, be an answer to say: this assertion, or its opposite is a misfiring attempt to express what can't be expressed like that. And that it does misfire can be shewn; but that isn't the end of the matter. We need to realize that what presents itself to us as the first expression of a difficulty, or of its solution, may as yet not be correctly expressed at all. Just as one who has a just censure of a picture to make will often at first offer the censure where it does not belong, and an investigation is needed in order to find the right point of attack for the critic. Knowledge in mathematics: Here one has to keep on reminding oneself of the unimportance of the 'inner process' or 'state' andY ask Why should it important What does it matter to me? What is interesting is how we use mathematical propositions. This is how calculation is done, in such circumstances a calculation is treated as absolutely reliable, as certainly correct. Upon I know that here is my hand there may follow the question How do you know? and the answer to that presupposes that ,iJcan be known in that way. So, instead of I know that here is my hand one might say Here is my hand and then add how one knows. I know where I am feeling pain I know that I feel it here is as wrong as I know that I am in pain. But I know. where you touched my arm is right. One can say He believes it, but it isn't so but not He knows it, but it isn't so. Does this stem from the difference between the mental states of belief and of knowledge? No. One may for example call mental state what is expGssed by tone of voice in speaking, by gestures etc. It would thus bepossible to speak of a mental state of conviction, and that may be the same whether it is knowledge or false belief. To think that different states must correspond to the words believe and know would be as if one believed that different people had to correspond to the word and the name Ludwig because the concepts are different,. What sort of proposition is this: We cannot have miscalculated in I It must surely be a proposition of logic. But now, is it not the same, or doesn't it come to the same, as the statement I. If you demand a rule from which it follows that there can't have been a miscalculation here, the answer is that we did not learn this through a rule, but by learning to calculate. We got to know the nature of calculating by learning to calculate. But then can't it be described how we satisfy ourselves of the reliability of a calculation? yes! Yet no rule emerges when we do so. But the most important thing is: The rule is not needed. Nothing is lacking. We do calculate according to a rule, and that is enough. This is how one calculates. Calculating is this. What we learn at school, for example. Forget this transcendent certainty, which is connected with your concept of spirit. However, out of a host of calculations certain ones might be designated as reliable once for all, others as not yet fixed. And now, is this a logical distinction?. But remember: even when the calculation is something fixed for me, this is only a decision for a practical purpose. lo. Whendoes onesay,Iknowthat. one has checked the calculation. . . .?When. What sort of proposition is: What could a mistake here be like! It would have to be a logical proposition. But it is a logic that is not used, because what it iellH us is not learned th;ough propositions. lt is a logical proposition; for it does describe the conceptual (linguistic) situation. This situation is thus not the same for a proposition like At this distance from the sun there is a planet and Here is a hand (namely my own hand). The secbnd can't be called a hypothesis. But there isn't a sharp boundary line between them. So one might grant that Moore was right, if he is interpreted like this: a proposition saying that here is a physical object may have the same logical status as one saying that here is a red patch. For it is not true that a mistake merely gets more and more improbable as we pass from the planet to my own hand. No: at some point it has ceased to be conceivable. This is already suggested by the following: if it were not so, it would also be conceivable that we should be wrong in every statement about physical objects; that any we ever make are mistaken. So is the othcsispossible, that all the things around us don't exist? Would that not be like the hypothesis of our having miscalculated in all our calculations . When one says: Perhaps this planet doesn't exist and the light phenomenon arises in some other way then after all one needs an example of an object which does exist. This doesn't exist, as for exumple does. Or are we to say that cerainfy is merely a constructed point to which some things approximate more, some less closely? No. Doubt gradually loses its sense. This language game just like that. And everything descriptive of a language game is part of logic. Now might not I I am not just surmising, that here is my hand be conceived as a proposition of grammar? Hence not temporally But in that case isn't it like this one: I know, I am not just surmising, that I am seeing red''. And isn't the consequence So there are physical objects like: there are colours If ''I know etc. is conceived as a grammatical proposition, of course the I cannot be important. And it properly means There is no such thing as a doubt in this case or The expression 'I do not know' makes no sense in this case. And of course it follows from this that I makes no sense either. 'I know is here a logical insight. Only realism can't be proved by means of it. It is wrong to say that the 'hypothesis' that thiJ is a bit of paper would be confirmed or disconfirmed by later experience, and that, in I know that this is a bit of paper, the I know either relates to such an hypothesis or to a logical determination. A meaning of a word is a kind of employment of it. For it is what we learn when the word is incorporated into our language. A. That is why there exists a correspondence between the concepts 'rule' and 'meaning'. If we imagine the facts otherwise than as they are, certain language games lose some of their importance, while others become important. And in this way there is an alteration a gradual one in the use of the vocabulary of a language. Compare the meaning of a word with the 'function' of an official. And 'different meanings' with 'different functions'. When language games change, then there is a change in concepts, and with the concepts the meanings of words change. I make assertions about reality, assertions which have different degrees of assurance. How does the degree of assurance come out? What conseauences has it We may be dealing, fGr example, with the certainty of memory, or again of perception. I may be sure of something, but still know what test might convince me of error. I am eg quite sure of the date of a bandle, but if I should find a different date in a recognized work of history, I should alter my opinion, and this would not mean I lost all faith in judging. Could we imagine a man who keeps on making mistakes where we regard a mistake as ruled out, and in fact never encounter one.g. he says he lives in such and such a place, is so and so old, comes from such and such a city, and he speaks with the same certainty (giving all the tokens of it) as I do, but he is wrong. But what is his relation to this error? What am I to suppose? The question is: what is the logician to say here?. I should like to say: '?f I am wrong about this, I have no guarantee that anything I say is true. But others won't say that about me, nor will I say it about other people. For months I have lived at address, I have read the name of the street and the number of the house countless times, have received countless letters here and given countless people the address. If I am wrong about it, the mistake is hardly less than if I were (wrongly) to believe I was writing Chinese and not German. If my friend were to imagine one day that he had been living for a long time past in such and such a place, etc. etc., I should not call this a mistake, but rather a mental disturbance, perhaps a transient one. Not every false belief of this sort is a mistake. But what is the difference between mistake and mental disturbance? Or what is the difference between my treating it as a mistake and my treating it as mental disturbance?. Can we say: a mi takedoesn't only have a cause, it also has a ground? I.e., roughly: when someone makes a mistake, this can be fitted into what he knows aright. Would this be correct: If I merely believed wrongly that there is a table here in front of me, this might still be a mistake; but if I believe wrongly that I have seen tGs table, or one like it, every day for several months past, and have regularly used it, that isn't a mistake?. Naturally, my aim must be to say what the statements one would like to make here, but cannot make significantly. Perhaps I shall do a multiplication twice to make sure, or perhaps get someone else to work it over. But shall I work it over again twenty times, or get twenty people to go over it? And is that some sort of negligence? Would the certainty really be greater for being checked twenty times? And can I give a reu onwhy it isn't?. That I am a man and not a woman can be verified, but if I were to say I was a woman, and then tried to explain the error by, saying I hadn't checked the statement, the explanation would not be accepted. The anda/tb of my statements is the test of my unde sfanding of these statements. That is to say: if I make certain false statements, it becomes uncertain whether I understand them. What counts as an adequate test of a statement belongs to logic. It belongs to the description of the language game. The a/thof certain empirical propositions belongs to our frame of reference. Moore says he that the earth existed long before his birth. And put like that it seems to be a personal statement about him, even if it is in addition a statement about the physical world. Now it is philosophically uninteresting whether Moore knows this or that, but it is interesting that, and how, it can be known. If Moore had informed us that he knew the distance separating certain stars, we might conclude from that that he had made some specialinvestigations, and we shall want to know what these were. But Moore chooses precisely a case in which we all seem to know the same as he, and without being able to say how. I believe eg that I know as much about this matter (the existence of the earth) as Moore does, and if he knows that it is as he says, then I know it too. For it isn't, either, as if he had arrived at his proposition by pursuing some line of thought which, while it is open to me, I have not in fact pursued. And what goes into someone's knowing this? Knowledge of history, say He must know what it means to say: the earth has already existed for such and such a length of time. For not any intelligent adult must know that. We see men building and demolishing houses, and are led to ask: How long has this house been here? But how does one come on the idea of askine this about a mountain, for example? And have all men the mandn; of the earth as a body, which anday come into being and pass away? Why shouldn't I think of the earth as flat, but extending: without endOinevery direction (including depth)? But in thatYcase one might still say I know that this mountain existed long before my birth. But suppose I met a man who didn't believe that?. Suppose I replaced Moore's I know by I am of the unshakeable conviction. Can't an assertoric sentence, which was capable of functioning as an hypothesis, also be used as a foundation for research and action?.e. can't it simply be isolated from doubt, though' not according to any explicit rule? It simply gets assumed as a truism, never called in question, perhaps not evenever formulated. It may be for example that all enquiry on our part is set so as to exempt certain ropositionsfrom doubt. if thev are ever formulated. ey lie apkt grom the route traveiled by enquiry. One would like to say: Everything speaks for, and nothing against the earth's having existed long before. Yet might I not believe the contrary after all? But the question is: What would the practical effects of this belief be? Perhaps someone says: That's not the point. A belief is what it is whether it has any practical effects or not. One thinks: It is the same adjustment of the human mind anyway. has a primitive meaning similar to and related to. I know ''I see wissen videre. And I knew he was in the room, but he wasn't in the room is like I saw him in the room, but he wasn't there. I know is supposed to express a ,relation, not between me and the sense of a proposition (like I believe but between me and a fact. So that andeandct is taken into my consdousness. (Here is the reason why one wants to say that nothing that goes on in the outer world is really known, but only what happens in the domain of what are called sense data.) This would give us a picture of knowing as the perception of an outer event though visual rays which project it as it is into the eye and the consciousneand. Only thin 'the question at once arises whether one can be certain of this projection. And this picture does indeed show how our imagination presents knowledge, but not what lies at the bottom of this presentation. If Moore says he knows the earth existed etc., most of us will grant him that it has existed all that time, and also believe him when he says he is convinced of it. But has he also got the right ground for his conviction For if not, then after all he doesn't know (Russell). However, we can ask: May someone have telling grounds for believing that the earth has only existed for a short time, say since his own birth? Suppose he had always been told that,would he have any good reason to doubt it? Men have believed that they could make rain; why should not a king be brought up in the belief that the world began with him? And if Moore and this king were to meet and discuss, could Moore really prove his belief to be the right one? I do not say that Moore could not convert the king to his view, but it would be a conversion of a special kind; the king would be brought to look at the world in a different way. Remember that one is sometimes convinced of the correctness of a view by its simplicity or gmmetry,.e, these arewhat induce one to go over to this point of view. One then simply says something like: That's how it must be.''. The propositions presenting what Moore 'hows' are all of such a kind that it is difficult to imagine why anyone should believe the contrary.g. the proposition andat Moore has spent his whole life in close proximity to the earth. Once more I can speak of myself here instead of speaking of Moore. What could induce me to believe the opposite? Either a memory, or having been told. Everything that I have seen or heard gives me the conviction that no man has ever been far from the ekth. Nothing in my picture of the world speaks in favour ot the opposite. . But I did not get my picture of the world by satisfying myself of its correctness: nor do I have it because I am satisfied of its correctness. No: is the inherited background against which I distinguish between true and false. The propositions describing this world picture might be Dart of a kind of mvtholoev. And their role is like that of rules of a game; and the game cand be learned purely practically, without learning any explicit rules. It might be imagined that some propositions, of the form of empirical propositions, were hardened and functioned as channels for such empirical propositions as were not hardened but fluid; and that this relation altered with time, in that fluid propositions hardened, and hard ones became fluid. The mythology may change back into a state of flux, the river bed of thoughts may shift. But I distinguish between the movement of the waters on the river bed and the shift of the bed itself; though there is not a sharp division of the one from the other. But if someone were to sav So logic too is an em irical science he would be wrong. ye; this is ryght: the same pioposition may get treated at one time as something to test by experience, at another as a rule of testing. And the bank of that river consists partly of hard rock, subject to no alteration or only to an imperceptible one, partly of sand, which now in one place now in another gets washed away, or deposited. The truths which Moore says he knows, are such as, roughly speaking, all of us know, if he knows them. Such a proposition might be eg My body has never disappeared and reappeared again after an interval. Might I not believe that once, without knowing it, perhaps in a state of unconsciousness, I was taken far away from the earth. that other people even know this, but do not mention it to me? But this would not fit into the rest of my convictions at all. Not that I could describe the system of these convictions. Yet my convictions do form a system, a structure. And now if I were to say It is my unshakeable conviction that etc. this means in the present case too that I have not consciously arrived at the conviction by following a particular line of thought, but that.it is anchored in all my questions and anwers, so anchored that I cannot touch it. I am for example also convinced that the sun is not a hole in the vault of heaven. All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system. And this system is not a more or less arbitrary and doubtful point of departure for all our arguments: no, it belongs to the essence of what we call an argumint. The system is norso much the point of departure, as the element in which arguments have their life. rob. Suppose some adult had told a child that he had been on the moon. The child tells me the story, and I say it was only a joke, the man hadn't been on the moon; no one has ever been on the moon; the moon is a long way off and it is impossible to climb up there or fly there. If now the child insists, saying perhaps there is a way of getting there which I don't know, etc. what reply could I make to him? What reply could I make to the adults of a tribe who believe that people sometimes go to the moon (perhaps that is how they interpret their dreams), and who indeed grant that there are no ordinary means of climbing up to it or flying there? But a child will not ordinarily stick to such a belief and will soon be convinced by what we tell him seriously. Isn't this altogether like the way one can instruct a child to believe in a God, or that none exists, and it will accordingly be able to produce apparently telling grounds for the one or the other But is there then no objective truth Isn't it true, or false, that someone has been on the moon? If we are thinking within our system, then it is certain that no one has ever been on the moon. Not merely is nothing of the sort ever seriously reported to us by reasonable people, but our whole system of physics forbids us to believe it. For this demands answers to the questions How did he overcome the force of gravity? How could he live without an atmosphere.? and a thousand others which could not be answered. But suppose that instead of all these answers we met the reply: We don't know how one gets to the moon, but those who get there know at once that they are there; and even you can't explain everyth\""
